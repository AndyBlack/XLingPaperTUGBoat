tool for producing academically oriented publications with features
required for linguistic publishing. We present the \TeX{} modules used
and the rationale for the history of \XLP{} development.

\section{Introduction}

Within the publishing industry there are several notable products for
producing complex documents in beautiful formats. \TeX{}
\cite{knuth:1984} \cite{knuth:1986} is one of the well known
publishing technologies used to meet these needs.  Since 2000,
\XML{}-based technologies such as
\XSLFO{}\footnote{\tbsurl{www.w3.org/TR/xsl11}} or the
\TeXML{}\footnote{\tbhurl{getfo.org/texml}} project \cite{lovell:1999}
have been used to integrate content and compose complex documents such
as textbooks and maintenance manuals. Requirements for composing these
large, inter-linked documents birthed the development of tools like
\XMLmind{}\footnote{\tbsurl{www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor}} and
Xpublisher.\footnote{\tbsurl{www.xpublisher.com/products}} These tools
can be used to compose content within predefined \XML{} structures.
\XLP{}, as discussed in \cite{blackandblack:2012} \cite{black:2009}
\cite{black:2017}, seeks to provide a constrained environment in which
authors of complex works dealing with language descriptions and
linguistic analyses can focus on content structure independently from
the styling requirements of documents. In this way the underlying
design principle of \XLP{} maximizes the \SGML\ design practice of
separating content from presentation. With \XLP{}, authors can keep
content structure independent from page layout information and thereby
provide maximal transfer-ability between publishing styles. The
software does this while providing authors a clear structured
interface for authoring content.

The \XLP{} software has a growing number of users who have
successfully typeset complex documents including:

\begin{itemize}
\item master theses \cite{Wood:2012} \cite{lamicela:2020} \cite{paterson:2021},
\item doctoral dissertations \cite{ebarb:2014} \cite{rasmussen:2018},
\item textbooks \cite{marlett:2019},
\item linguistic grammars \cite{buck:2018},
\item books \cite{bartholomew:2019} \cite{rastorgueva:2012},
\item journal articles \cite{brownie:2013}, and
\item bilingual software documentation \cite{BeadleandLee:2020a} \cite{BeadleandLee:2020b}.
\end{itemize}

\section{What is \XLP{}?}
XLingpaper\footnote{\tbsurl{software.sil.org/xlingpaper}} is a plug-in
to the \XXE{}. \XLP{} benefits from the \XXE{}'s Java-based
implementation which allows it to be used on \MacOSX{}, Windows, and
Linux. Via a \DTD{}, \XLP{} defines several document classes
(articles, books, chapters, etc., as illustrated in Figure~1), in each
case providing document layout sections (paragraphs, examples,
endnotes, etc.). By working within the user-interface of the \XXE{},
as shown in Figure~2, formatting errors are reduced because users are
constrained on where in the document flow they can introduce block and
line level document elements.  That is, first, authors cannot input
\XeLaTeX{} code directly into the document and second, the
introduction of layout sections within the document flow is
constrained via the \DTD{}.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[scale=.425]{Several-different-document-types.png}
\caption{\XLP{} predefined document types via \DTD{}}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[scale=.243]{XLingPaper-interface.png}
\caption{\XLP{}'s user interface. Left side: document content editing. Right side: block and line level units available for use at the cursor location.}
\end{figure*}

\XLP{} is designed to reduce friction in the process of writing,
reading, composing, and publishing linguistic papers, grammars, and
books by removing common time-sinks related to inconsistent formatting
(especially citations, references, and numbered element like
examples). A full list of benefits to all parties in the publishing
work flow is available \cite{black:2017}. For many, the \PDF{} format
is the quintessential file format for final distribution of publishing
outputs. \XLP{} supports \PDF{} production but as illustrated in
Figure~3, \XLP{} can produce documents with at least five outputs, all
from the same source document:
\begin{itemize}
\item \PDF{} (version 1.5),
\item Web pages (\HTML{} 4),
\item Microsoft Word (.doc),
\item Open Office Writer Document (.odt), and
\item e\acro{PUB}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[scale=.8]{PDFCreation.png}
\caption{\XLP{}'s data processing pipeline to multiple formats}
\end{figure*}

\XLP{} automatically numbers tables, examples, figures, and
sections. It keeps track of internal references to these entities
along with citation references, abbreviations, and gloss
abbreviations.  This keeps numbering and reference links dependable
and automated. \XLP{} also automatically generates indexes, a
table or list of abbreviations used, and a section for references
cited (using a custom references implementation).

Unlike most editing programs which are based on either the \WYSIWYG{}
paradigm or as text editors used to code or produce Markdown,
\XLP{} (via the \XXE{}) is a structured editor. Rather than
visually structuring the document to look the way it is to be
formatted, the author “marks up” the items in the document according
to their kind.  One of the many benefits that using a \DTD{} provides
is that there is a “grammar” of what a well-formed linguistic document
looks like.  This makes moving, replacing, switching, or reordering
sections, chapters, tables, figures, and examples less error prone because it prevents
users from inadvertently creating ill-formed documents. The following
sections of this paper discuss the \TeX{} technologies used by
\XLP{}.

\section{\XLP{} and \TeX{}}

Linguistic publishing has unique requirements when compared to general
publishing. The following sections provide more detail on the
linguistic publishing context, design requirements and \LaTeX{}
packages used by \XLP{}.

\subsection{ \TeX{} and Linguistic document production}

\TeX{} has long been embraced by linguists. Peter \cite{peter:2004}
writes of a personal communication with Don Knuth where Knuth suggests
that linguists were some of the earliest adopters outside of
mathematicians.  Thiele \cite{thiele:2007} in an interview given in
2007 states that she was typesetting linguistic journals via \TeX{} in
1983---a date prior to the release of Knuth's book on using the \TeX{}
typesetting system \cite{knuth:1984}. Thiele \cite{thiele:1995} gives
an early overview of \TeX{} use in linguistics with mention of
significant repositories outside of \CTAN{}. A slightly more recent
(2004) update by Peter \cite{peter:2004} provides some additional tips
and tools for typesetting common information structures in linguistic
publishing. The \TeX{} community has produced many packages which have
shaped the visual face of publishing in linguistics, including
\texttt{tipa}\footnote{\tbsurl{ctan.org/pkg/tipa}} by Rei
\cite{rei:1996} which provided access to an excellent typeface for
phonetic transcriptions and
\texttt{pst-asr}\footnote{\tbsurl{ctan.org/pkg/pst-asr}} by Frampton
\cite{frampton:2006} for autosegmental representations. Some packages
used in linguistic publishing are not exclusive to linguistics. For
example, Donnelly \cite{donnelly:2013} describes how to use various
packages to draw phonetic pitch traces using \TeX{}. Peter
\cite{peter:2004} and Thiele \cite{thiele:1995} list out and review
(through 2004) various packages across several areas of lingustics,
including several packages used to draw syntax trees such as
\texttt{qtrees}\footnote{\tbsurl{ctan.org/pkg/qtrees}} and
\texttt{forest}\footnote{\tbsurl{ctan.org/pkg/forest}} to specialized
packages for presenting examples and interlinear glossed texts such as
\texttt{expex}.\footnote{\tbsurl{ctan.org/pkg/expex}} In addition to
packages which provide specific functionality, there are packages
which are essentially collections of macros such as
\texttt{covington}\footnote{\tbsurl{ctan.org/pkg/covington}} and
\texttt{gb4e}\footnote{\tbsurl{ctan.org/pkg/gb4e}} which serve a
variety of page layout functions targeted at publishing in linguistic
topics.

The \CTAN{} repository currently lists fifty-four different \TeX{}
packages for linguistic
typesetting,\footnote{\tbsurl{ctan.org/topic/linguistic}} though some
of these packages also include capabilities targeted as multi-lingual
or multi-script publications or are specific style sheet
implementations for publications at linguistic programs at
institutions of higher education (there may be more packages which are not
tagged but should be). Several of the packages tagged “linguistic”
pre-date Unicode \cite{unicode:1991} but still see significant
use. Sometimes it is the case that secondary packages are developed in
an attempt to “fix” publishing outputs in different ways to bring
Unicode features along with the features of the original package. For
example, \texttt{tipa} is not Unicode compatible, but the packages
\texttt{unitipa}\footnote{\tbsurl{ctan.org/pkg/unitipa}} and
\texttt{tipauni}\footnote{\tbsurl{ctan.org/pkg/tipauni}} seek to
address different implications of not publishing with Unicode while
giving access to the beautiful typeface of \texttt{tipa}. Understanding
the long history of publishing and the interdependency that packages
have presents additional complexities to new \TeX{} users.

Mentioning these complexities is important to the \XLP{}
discussion for two reasons. First, it exemplifies some of the
complexities that \XLP{} seeks to simplify as it presents authors
not just a visual environment for document composition, but also a
cohesive output solution. Second, while the diagrams in linguistic
books and journals since the 1980's exemplify many beautiful, sharp,
crisp, illustrations created directly in \TeX{}, many trainers of
\TeX{} tools,\footnote{Among others, see
the Linguistics Dissertation guide for the University of
Hawai{\SpecialCharactersFont{ʻ}}i at Mānoa \cite{holton:2021},
University of Pennsylvania \cite{dimitriadis:2016}, and Language
Science Press Guidelines \cite{nordhoffandmueller:2020}.} but not all,\footnote{For counter examples see
\cite{liter:2017} \cite{smithsniderwiegand:2016}
\cite{freitagupriemer:2019} and \cite{priemerufreitag:2019}.} have
steered authors towards a more generic set of packages which do not
include specific diagram creating macros. Rather, they
suggest that authors use secondary illustration tools to generate
illustrations and then include them as vector \PDF{}s or images. In
fact this second method is the document production path that the
\XLP{} philosophy follows. That is, \XLP{} reduces the
complexity of the typesetting task for authors by requiring complex
visualizations to be produced via graphical tools. We have found tools
like Figma\footnote{\tbhurl{www.figma.com}} and
Inkscape\footnote{\tbhurl{inkscape.org}} very helpful in the graphic
production task.

As mentioned in the discussion of \texttt{tipa}, Linguistic documents
have not always been typeset with Unicode. Unicode was introduced in
1991 and by the early 2000's Unicode along with document and data
storage in \XML{} formats were being heralded in academic linguistics
as a best practice in order to avoid vendor lock-in, increase
interoperability across use cases, and to separate data life-cycles
from encoding or software life-cycles \cite{BirdSimons:2002}
\cite{BirdSimons:2003} \cite{ward:2002}. Due to the heavy reliance on
Unicode by today's practitioners of language documentation and
linguistic work, \XLP{} specifically uses \XeLaTeX{} and
compatible packages to produce \PDF{} outputs. This brings continuity
to the text input process for users across their workflows. It also
makes importing and using language or phonetically transcribed
examples simpler by removing the need to use macros to derive
characters.

\subsection{Design desiderata for \XLP{} outputs via \TeX{}}
%Andy: Is there an open repository for XLingPaper development? What is the code base licensed under?
From the outset, \XLP{} was designed to be free.  The \XXE{} had a
Personal Use License that met this requirement for the vast majority
of the target audience of \XLP{}.  The few who did not meet the
terms of that license most likely would be able to afford to purchase
(or have their organization purchase) a professional version of the
\XXE{}.  The actual \XLP{} plug-in has always been free.

\XLP{} development started in 2001. In 2006, it added \XSLFO{}
for \PDF{} production. Prior to 2009, \XLP{} used
RenderX\footnote{\tbhurl{www.renderx.com}} to produce \PDF{}
documents. However, in 2009 plans were made to add \XeLaTeX-based
output to \XLP{} because, while there was a free version of
RenderX, the output contained a watermark.  By implementing the
ability to export to \PDF{} via \XeLaTeX, there would be no water
marks in \PDF{} documents. The \XeLaTeX{} method of \PDF{} production
is now the default method to produce \PDF{} documents.

When the \XeLaTeX{} method of \PDF{} production was introduced,
\XLP{} had a way to format output per a user-created publisher
style sheet.  This meant the developer (Andrew Black) needed to be
able to map from an \XLP{} publisher style sheet to \XeLaTeX.
Mapping style sheet information contained in the \XML{} was the second
criterion.  It was known that \LaTeX\ was the ideal \TeX{}
implementation to target. However, pure \LaTeX\ came with predefined
output formatting for front matter, chapters, sections, back matter,
etc.  Pure \LaTeX, then, would not allow direct control of formatting
of all of these per an \XLP{} user-defined publisher style sheet.
This meant overriding these standard features of \LaTeX\ with a custom
implementation of the \TeX{} commands needed to control
formatting. \XLP{} takes a custom approach in implementing flexibility here. However,
\texttt{memoir}\footnote{\tbsurl{ctan.org/pkg/memoir}}
\cite{wilson:2007} \cite{wilson:2021}, a recent discovery for the
programmer of \XLP{}, accomplishes many of the same tasks and
could be considered to replace some of the custom code if it were
shown to be easy to implement and that the size of the total
\XLP{} code base would be reduced.

The third criterion concerned some of the target audience for \XLP{}.
Many of the expected users of \XLP{} live and work in places around
the world where Internet connections are characterized by high costs,
low bandwidth capacity, and general unavailability.  Therefore, the
download required to install \XLP{} needed to be as small as possible.
The size constraint impacts \XLP{} because its distribution must be
independent of larger mainstream \TeX{} distribution solutions such as
\TeX{}Live which have a large footprint.  Therefore the developer
determined which \LaTeX\ packages and binaries were needed and created
a custom installation package which met the required specifications.

\XLP{} currently uses the following \LaTeX{} packages (in
alphabetical order):

\begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
\texttt{attachfile2} & \texttt{lineno}\\
\texttt{booktabs} & \texttt{longtable}\\
\texttt{calc} & \texttt{lscape}\\
\texttt{color} & \texttt{mdframed}\\
\texttt{colortbl} & \texttt{multirow}\\
\texttt{etoolbox} & \texttt{normalem}\\
\texttt{fancyhdr} & \texttt{polyglossia}\\
\texttt{fontspec} & \texttt{setspace}\\
\texttt{footmisc} & \texttt{tabularx}\\
\texttt{hyperref} & \texttt{xltxtra}\\
\end{tabular}

The twenty \LaTeX\ packages that are part of the custom \XLP{}
distribution are still rather large for someone for whom Internet
bandwidth is an expensive and inconsistent commodity. To reduce
bandwidth requirements two assumptions were made which have more or
less proven to obtain. The first assumption that the developer made
was that the twenty packages and binaries would not need to change
over time; in contrast, the second assumption was that \XLP{}
would acquire new features and need bug fixes. These assumptions
resulted in an architecture where page layout information expressed in
\XML{} is translated via custom \TeX{} commands to either \TeX{}
directly or to commands understood by \LaTeX{} packages distributed
with \XLP{}. This abstraction layer was then executed when the
\XeLaTeX{} file was processed. This middle layer has granted
\XLP{} flexibility in adding new code and capabilities while
keeping the “heavy” \LaTeX\ packages stable. The net result is a
“heavy” first install package, but light-weight upgrade packages. In
the thirteen year history of development, there have been a few
occasions where upgrades have required the download of new “heavy”
packages. One such case was when the ability to use framed units was added. These
elements depend on the
\texttt{mdframed}\footnote{\tbsurl{ctan.org/pkg/mdframed}}
package \cite{DanielandSchubert:2013}. The architecture separating
stable packages from custom code, however, has generally worked out
well and kept update sizes low.

\subsection{\PDF{} production}

There are two known pathways for converting XML content into PDFs. The
first is via \XSLFO{}, and the second is via \TeXML{} which converts
\XML{} content to \TeX{} formatted documents. Given certain
limitations in both \XSLFO{} and \TeXML{}, \XLP{} uses a custom
(or third) method. When an author instructs \XLP{} to produce
\PDF{} output via \XeLaTeX, \XLP{} produces a \TeXML{}-like \XML{}
file. This is then converted into a \LaTeX\ formatted document via a set
of \XSLT{} transforms and processed via \XeLaTeX{} to produce the
\PDF{}.  Figure~3 contains a diagram of the data handling process.

\subsection{\TeXML{}}

\TeXML{} was discovered in the process of planning for the transition
of the default \PDF{} renderer from RenderX (an \XSLFO{} processor) to
\XeLaTeX{}. Initial analysis conducted in 2009 understood \TeXML{} to
have two infelicities for use-cases required in linguistic publishing
with \XLP{}:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \TeXML{} has Python as a dependency and the developer did not
  want to require \XLP{} users to install a version of Python
  specifically for \TeXML{}.  This is especially the case since that
  version of Python might conflict with other installed versions of
  Python on their operating systems.  Moreover, this approach would
  make the installation package for \XLP{} much larger due to the
  inclusion of Python.
\item \XLP{} users require a high degree of control for white
  space. The fine grain control of whitespace was not clearly possible
  via \TeXML{}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Control characters}

Even with the use of Unicode in the text of documents, there are some
features of typesetting with \TeX{}-based implementations which
require the use of control characters. Additionally, \XML{} also has
control characters. In \TeX{} these include \texttt{{[}},
  \texttt{{]}}, \texttt{\textless{}}, and
\texttt{\textgreater{}}. When transforming data between \XML{} and
\TeX{}, \TeX{} control characters and commands need to be escaped to
ensure proper data processing. This has been implemented via Java
since Java was already present in the dependency stack due to \XXE{}
requiring it. Additionally, some small methods have been written in
Java to provide additional access to features via the graphical user
interface.

\subsection{Ling-\TeX{}}

One might ask, “Why not add more linguistic related \TeX{} packages to
the available stack, or use those instead of creating custom code?”
The answer has two simple parts: First, in 2009 the linguistic
capabilities of \TeX{} packages were different than they are today.
Second, \XLP{} is more than a \TeX{} document producer.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[scale=.525]{Outputs.png}
\caption{\XLP{} combines style and content information contained
  in its custom XML and then exports it into three different formats
  for further processing.}
\end{figure}

Besides \TeX{}, \XLP{} also produces \XSLFO{} and
\XHTML{}/\CSS{} outputs. When new features are considered for typesetting design, all output formats need to be considered.


When the developer began to implement the
\XeLaTeX{}-based output, he discovered the Ling-\TeX{}
group\footnote{\tbhurl{web.archive.org/web/20150702123633/http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~dag/ling-tex/}}
which also ran the Ling-TeX mailing list from
1995–2018.\footnote{\tbsurl{ling-tex.ifi.uio.narkive.com}} Ling-TeX
seemed to be the locus of activity in linguistic typesetting even
though other web pages discussing linguistics and \TeX{} also existed,
e.g.,
Essex,\footnote{\tbsurl{www.essex.ac.uk/linguistics/external/clmt/latex4ling}}
UPenn.\footnote{\tbsurl{www.ling.upenn.edu/advice/latex.html}} Today,
now that the mailing list is no-longer in operation, many of the
mailing list participants can be found interacting on the \TeX{}
stackexchange.\footnote{\tbsurl{tex.stackexchange.com}}

State-of-the-Art for \TeX{}-based linguistic publishing in 2009, as
recommended by the Ling-\TeX{} website, suggested using
\texttt{covington} and {\em ling-mac}—the list of macros discussed in
\cite{thiele:1995}. These macros were used to solve similar use cases,
among others, to those already implemented by \XLP{}. The more
commonly implemented typesetting tasks are outlined in Section~4.
%These figure refs need to be re-evaluated for accuracy since I added another figure.
Initial analysis of \texttt{covington} and other packages revealed
limitations in the number of rows an interlinear text example could
display, a typesetting capability \XLP{} had already overcome via
\XSLFO{} processing using RenderX. \XLP{} had the following
capabilities for typesetting interlinears:

\begin{itemize}
\item no limits on the number of lines within an interlinear grouping;
\item no limits on the number of free and/or literal lines;
\item the ability to include a source reference within the
  interlinear; and especially
\item the ability to tag interlinear items with an \acro{ISO} 639-3
  code for the language used in the interlinear.
\end{itemize}

At the time the best solution given the state of the \TeX{} packages
available was custom \TeX{} scripts, although now similar features may
be possible via other packages. See Pellard \cite{pellard:2019} for
discussion of approaches in \TeX{} and his solution
\texttt{typgloss}.\footnote{\tbsurl{github.com/tpellard/typgloss}}
Figures~5–7 contain example output illustrating some of the special
capabilities \XLP{} offers.

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[scale=.97]{ExamplePDFInterlinear.png}
\caption{Interlinear example from \cite{marlett:2012}. Note the
  example numbers on the left followed by example groups (a) and
  (b). Each interlinear then also has a language indicator in square
  brackets. Customization allows for as many rows per group as is
  required. Finally, on the right the hyperlinked reference to the
  source text is indicated.}
\end{figure*}

\section{Typesetting tasks \XLP{} users often encounter}
%I am here Note: ExPex does not have the language code or the citation. langsci-gb4 supports Leipzig Glossing Rules which put the language on the right hand side and do not have a citation within the context of the example. linguex does not have either language or citation built in.
Linguistic documents have several formatting needs that other kinds of
documents do not. This section discusses some of them.

\subsection{Numbered example layouts}

Linguistic documents usually have many numbered examples.  The prose
often refers to examples near the material or to previous examples.
\XLP{} automatically keeps track of the numbers.  Authors, and
publishing style sheets often make use of table-like design layouts
including: lists of words along with their glosses (as shown in
Figure~6) and interlinear clauses (as shown in Figure~5), with some
cases even having headings in portions of the example.

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{GraphitePDF-Slide24.png}
\caption{List of words as seen in \cite{rasmussen:2018}}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Automatically wrapping interlinear texts}

Many linguists want to include interlinear glossed text in their
document.  \XLP{} allows these to be wrapped automatically which
makes the author's job much easier.  Figure~5 shows one such text
portion.

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[scale=0.97]{TextPDF-Slide21.png}
\caption{Wrapped interlinear text as seen in \cite{nmeAndMarlett:2011}.}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Gloss abbreviations}

Linguists standardly use glosses for indicating the meaning of pieces
of words (morphemes).  \XLP{} allows the author to define a set of
abbreviations and their definitions.  When producing the output,
\XLP{} creates hyperlinks between the abbreviation and its
definition.

%\cite{lehmann:2004}

\section{Outputs \LaTeX{} allow that others do not}

While \XLP{} has a large array of linguistically-oriented
formatting capabilities, there are some that only the \XeLaTeX{}
output can produce.  This is, of course, due to the formatting power
of \TeX{} and \XeLaTeX{}.

\subsection{Automatically wrapping interlinears}

One of the most popular features of \XLP{} is its ability to
automatically wrap long interlinear examples and lines in interlinear
texts.  It does so by formatting each aligned word in an hbox and then
having \XeLaTeX{} put them together in a hanging indent paragraph.
This is based on the work of Kew \& McConnel 1990 \cite{kew:mcconnel}.

\subsection{Font rendering}
%for discussing fonts several works need to be added to the bibliography: http://root.tug.org/tugboat/tb29-1/tb91kew.pdf, https://www.w3.org/Talks/2003/Extending%20SVG%20Fonts%20with%20Graphite.pdf, http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.530.8865, http://rabbits.continuation.org/w/images/7/73/Graphite_paper.pdf, https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.libproxy.uoregon.edu/doi/abs/10.1002/spe.819
\XeLaTeX{} renders fonts extremely well.  It can even handle special
features requiring Graphite\footnote{\tbsurl{graphite.sil.org}}
processing.  For other outputs, some fonts (such as Charis \SIL{}) may
not line up vertically as expected due to them having different
ascender and descender values. One has to add custom commands to deal
with these.  In the case of Graphite, they may not be able to be done
at all.  The RenderX way of producing \PDF{} cannot handle stacked
diacritics, but the \XeLaTeX{} way does it very well.

\subsection{Hyphenation for non-English languages}

Since we use the \texttt{polyglossia} package, one can write an
\XLP{} document in a non-English language and \XeLaTeX{} will
hyphenate according to that language’s hyphenation rules.

\subsection{Author contact information}

\XLP{} allows one to define a set of contact information for
authors.  Only the \XeLaTeX{} output is able to format them correctly.

\subsection{Vertical fill}

For title page material, only the \XeLaTeX{} output allows using
vertical fill between items.  The other outputs require using overt,
fixed spacing values.

\subsection{Blank page}

When one wants a totally blank even-numbered page between a final
odd-numbered page and the next odd-numbered page which begins, say, a
chapter or appendix, only the \XeLaTeX{} approach is able to do this.

\section{Features other outputs have that the \LaTeX{} output does not}

\XeLaTeX{} does not allow for custom table cell padding and spacing.
Having said that, Andy cannot remember any \XLP{} user ever asking
for a way to do this for the \XeLaTeX{} output.  It just looks great.

Background color is not available for section titles.

Section 11.17.1.1 “Known limitations of using
\XeLaTeX{}” in the \XLP{} user documentation lists known
problems.
%  See \tbsurl{software.sil.org/downloads/r/xlingpaper/resources/documentation/xxe7/UserDocXMLmind.htm#sXeTeXLimitations}.

\subsection{Custom \TeX{} commands}

\XLP{} has a number of custom commands that enable it to handle
various tasks in a way that is consistent with our desired outcomes.
The following lists some of them in a schematic way:

\begin{tabular}{@{}lp{1.5in}@{}}
{\bf Command for} & {\bf Purpose}\\
Table of contents & Store and retrieve page numbers; format the

\section{Conclusion}

While the \XLP{} approach to composing documents via DTD controlled
user interface limitations has great value in and of itself, the fact
that it can produce great looking output via \XeLaTeX{} makes the
learning curve rewarding.  We feel that being able to produce \PDF{}
via \XeLaTeX{} has made \XLP{} a fantastic tool for linguists.
