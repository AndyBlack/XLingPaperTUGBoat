tool for producing academically oriented publications with features
required for linguistic publishing. We present the \TeX{} modules used
and the rationale for the history of \XLP{} development.

\section{Introduction}

Within the publishing industry there are several notable products for
producing complex documents in beautiful formats. \TeX{}
\cite{knuth:1984} \cite{knuth:1986} is one of the well known
publishing technologies used to meet these needs.  Since 2000,
\XML{}-based technologies such as
\XSLFO{}\footnote{\tbsurl{www.w3.org/TR/xsl11}} or the
\TeXML{}\footnote{\tbhurl{getfo.org/texml}} project \cite{lovell:1999}
have been used to integrate content and compose complex documents such
as textbooks and maintenance manuals. Requirements for composing these
large, inter-linked documents birthed the development of tools like
\XMLmind{}\footnote{\tbsurl{www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor}} and
Xpublisher.\footnote{\tbsurl{www.xpublisher.com/products}} These tools
can be used to compose content within predefined \XML{} structures.
\XLP{}, as discussed in \cite{blackandblack:2012} \cite{black:2009}
\cite{black:2017}, seeks to provide a constrained environment in which
authors of complex works dealing with language descriptions and
linguistic analyses can focus on content structure independently from
the styling requirements of documents. In this way the underlying
design principle of \XLP{} maximizes the \SGML\ design practice of
separating content from presentation. With \XLP{}, authors can keep
content structure independent from page layout information and thereby
provide maximal transfer-ability between publishing styles. The
software does this while providing authors a clear structured
interface for authoring content.

The \XLP{} software has a growing number of users who have
successfully typeset complex documents including:

\begin{itemize}
\item master theses \cite{Wood:2012} \cite{lamicela:2020} \cite{paterson:2021},
\item doctoral dissertations \cite{ebarb:2014} \cite{rasmussen:2018},
\item textbooks \cite{marlett:2019},
\item linguistic grammars \cite{buck:2018},
\item books \cite{bartholomew:2019} \cite{rastorgueva:2012},
\item journal articles \cite{brownie:2013}, and
\item bilingual software documentation \cite{BeadleandLee:2020a} \cite{BeadleandLee:2020b}.
\end{itemize}

\section{What is \XLP{}?}
XLingpaper\footnote{\tbsurl{software.sil.org/xlingpaper}} is a plug-in
to the \XXE{}. \XLP{} benefits from the \XXE{}'s Java-based
implementation which allows it to be used on \MacOSX{}, Windows, and
Linux. Via a \DTD{}, \XLP{} defines several document classes
(articles, books, chapters, etc., as illustrated in Figure~1), in each
case providing document layout sections (paragraphs, examples,
endnotes, etc.). By working within the user-interface of the \XXE{},
as shown in Figure~2, formatting errors are reduced because users are
constrained on where in the document flow they can introduce block and
line level document elements.  That is, first, authors cannot input
page layout instructions directly into the document and second, the
introduction of layout sections within the document flow is
constrained via the \DTD{}.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[scale=.425]{Several-different-document-types.png}
\caption{\XLP{} predefined document types via \DTD{}}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure*}

\caption{\XLP{}'s user interface. Left side: document content editing. Right side: block and line level units available for use at the cursor location.}
\end{figure*}

\XLP{} is designed to reduce friction in the process of writing, composing, and publishing linguistic papers, grammars, and
books by removing common time-sinks related to inconsistent formatting
(especially citations, references, and numbered element like
examples). A full list of benefits to all parties in the publishing
work flow is available \cite{black:2017}. For many, the \PDF{} format
is the quintessential file format for final distribution of publishing
outputs. \XLP{} supports \PDF{} production but as illustrated in
Figure~3, \XLP{} can produce documents with at least five outputs, all
from the same source document:
\begin{itemize}
\item \PDF{} (version 1.5),
\item Web pages (\HTML{} 4),
\item Microsoft Word (.doc),
\item Open Office Writer Document (.odt), and
\item e\acro{PUB}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[scale=.8]{PDFCreation.png}
\caption{\XLP{}'s data processing pipeline to multiple formats}
\end{figure*}

\XLP{} automatically numbers tables, examples, figures, and
sections. It keeps track of internal references to these entities
along with citation references, abbreviations, and gloss
abbreviations.  This keeps numbering and reference links dependable
and automated. \XLP{} also automatically generates indexes, a
table or list of abbreviations used, and a section for references
cited (using a custom references implementation).

Unlike most editing programs which are based on either the \WYSIWYG{}
paradigm or are unconstrained text editors such as those used to code or produce Markdown,
\XLP{} (via the \XXE{}) is a structured editor much more like the block editors we see in tools like MailChimp or WordPress's Gutenburg editor; albiet without the drag-and-drop features. Rather than
visually structuring the document to look the way it is to be
formatted, the author “marks up” the items in the document according
to their kind.  One of the many benefits that using a \DTD{} provides
is that there is a “grammar” of what a well-formed linguistic document
looks like.  This makes moving, replacing, switching, or reordering
sections, chapters, tables, figures, and examples less error prone because it prevents
users from inadvertently creating ill-formed documents. The following
sections of this paper discuss the \TeX{} technologies used by
\XLP{}.

\section{\XLP{} and \TeX{}}

Linguistic publishing has unique requirements when compared to general
publishing. The following sections provide more detail on the
linguistic publishing context, design requirements and \LaTeX{}
packages used by \XLP{}.

\subsection{ \TeX{} and Linguistic document production}

\TeX{} has long been embraced by linguists. Peter \cite{peter:2004}
writes of a personal communication with Don Knuth where Knuth suggests
that linguists were some of the earliest adopters outside of
mathematicians.  Thiele \cite{thiele:2007} in an interview given in
2007 states that she was typesetting linguistic journals via \TeX{} in
1983---a date prior to the release of Knuth's book on using the \TeX{}
typesetting system \cite{knuth:1984}. Thiele \cite{thiele:1995} gives
an early overview of \TeX{} use in linguistics with mention of
significant repositories outside of \CTAN{}. A slightly more recent
(2004) update by Peter \cite{peter:2004} provides some additional tips
and tools for typesetting common information structures in linguistic
publishing. The \TeX{} community has produced many packages which have
shaped the visual face of publishing in linguistics, including
\texttt{tipa}\footnote{\tbsurl{ctan.org/pkg/tipa}} by Rei
\cite{rei:1996} which provided access to an excellent typeface for
phonetic transcriptions and
\texttt{pst-asr}\footnote{\tbsurl{ctan.org/pkg/pst-asr}} by Frampton
\cite{frampton:2006} for autosegmental representations. Some packages
used in linguistic publishing are not exclusive to linguistics. For
example, Donnelly \cite{donnelly:2013} describes how to use various
packages to draw phonetic pitch traces using \TeX{}. Peter
\cite{peter:2004} and Thiele \cite{thiele:1995} list out and review
(through 2004) various packages across several areas of lingustics. Among others, they discuss several packages used to draw syntax trees such as
\texttt{qtrees}\footnote{\tbsurl{ctan.org/pkg/qtrees}} and
\texttt{forest}\footnote{\tbsurl{ctan.org/pkg/forest}} and specialized
packages for presenting examples and interlinear glossed texts such as
\texttt{expex}.\footnote{\tbsurl{ctan.org/pkg/expex}} Their reviews also discuss packages
which are essentially collections of macros such as
\texttt{covington}\footnote{\tbsurl{ctan.org/pkg/covington}} and
\texttt{gb4e}\footnote{\tbsurl{ctan.org/pkg/gb4e}} which serve a
variety of page layout functions targeted at publishing in linguistic
topics.

The \CTAN{} repository currently lists fifty-four different \TeX{}
packages for linguistic
typesetting,\footnote{\tbsurl{ctan.org/topic/linguistic}} though some
of these packages also include capabilities targeted as multi-lingual
or multi-script publications or are specific style sheet
implementations for publications at linguistic programs at
institutions of higher education (there may be more packages which are
not tagged but should be). Several of the packages tagged “linguistic”
pre-date Unicode \cite{unicode:1991} but still see significant
use. Sometimes it is the case that secondary packages are developed in
an attempt to “fix” publishing outputs in different ways to bring
Unicode features along with the features of the original package. For
example, \texttt{tipa} is not Unicode compatible, but the packages
\texttt{unitipa}\footnote{\tbsurl{ctan.org/pkg/unitipa}} and
\texttt{tipauni}\footnote{\tbsurl{ctan.org/pkg/tipauni}} seek to
address different implications of not publishing with Unicode while
giving access to the beautiful typeface of
\texttt{tipa}. Understanding the long history of publishing and the
interdependency that packages have (including the order of loading
packages) presents additional barriers of adoption to new \TeX{}
users.

\TeX{} barriers of adoption are important to the \XLP{} discussion for
two reasons. First, it exemplifies some of the complexities that
\XLP{} seeks to simplify as it presents authors not just a visual
environment for document composition, but also a cohesive output
solution. Second, it speaks to the software design process in finding
the minimal viable product. That is, {\em how much of a software stack is
needed to make a useable software product for lingustic publishing?}
The \TeX{} community is divided on this. While the diagrams in
linguistic books and journals since the 1980's exemplify many
beautiful, sharp, crisp, illustrations created directly in \TeX{},
many trainers of \TeX{} tools,\footnote{Among others, see the
Linguistics Dissertation guide for the University of
Hawai{\SpecialCharactersFont{ʻ}}i at Mānoa \cite{holton:2021},
University of Pennsylvania \cite{dimitriadis:2016}, and Language
Science Press Guidelines \cite{nordhoffandmueller:2020}.} but not
all,\footnote{For counter examples see \cite{liter:2017}
\cite{smithsniderwiegand:2016} \cite{freitagupriemer:2019} and
\cite{priemerufreitag:2019}.} have steered authors towards a more
generic set of packages which do not include specific diagram creating
macros. Rather, they suggest that authors use secondary illustration
tools to generate illustrations and then include them as vector
\PDF{}s or images. In fact this second method is the document
production path that the \XLP{} philosophy follows. That is, \XLP{}
reduces the complexity of the typesetting task for authors by
requiring complex visualizations to be produced via graphical
tools. We have found tools like Figma\footnote{\tbhurl{www.figma.com}}
and Inkscape\footnote{\tbhurl{inkscape.org}} very helpful in the
graphic production task. The \XLP{} product seeks to lower
barriers of entry, only produce valid documents, and keep the code
base to a minimum.

As mentioned in the discussion of \texttt{tipa}, Linguistic documents
have not always been typeset with Unicode. Unicode was introduced in
1991 and by the early 2000's Unicode along with document and data
storage in \XML{} formats were being heralded in academic linguistics
as a best practice in order to avoid vendor lock-in, increase
interoperability across use cases, and to separate data life-cycles
from encoding or software life-cycles \cite{BirdSimons:2002}
\cite{BirdSimons:2003} \cite{ward:2002}. Due to the heavy reliance on
Unicode by today's practitioners of language documentation and
linguistic work, \XLP{} specifically uses \XeLaTeX{} and
compatible packages to produce \PDF{} outputs. This brings continuity
to the text input process for users across their workflows. It also
makes importing and using language or phonetically transcribed
examples simpler by removing the need to use macros to derive
characters.

\subsection{Design desiderata for \XLP{} outputs via \TeX{}}

There have been three goals which have influenced the development of XLingPaper:

\begin{itemize}
\item separation of content and style,
\item software accessibility (license and size), and
\item beautiful multi-format outputs.
\end{itemize}

Deciding how \TeX{} technologies fit within the project has been a
journey. \XLP{} development started in 2001 without any use of  \TeX{} technologies. In 2006, \XLP{} added
\XSLFO{} for \PDF{} production. Prior to 2009, \XLP{} used
RenderX\footnote{\tbhurl{www.renderx.com}} to produce \PDF{}
documents. As far as we know, RenderX's XEP application is the only cross-platform \XSLFO{} processer written in Java. \XSLFO{} processors can have various degrees of implementation of the \XSLFO{} standard. XEP has decent coverage, but also has some limitations which limits page layout. These limiations are discussed in Section 6. In 2009 plans were made to add \XeLaTeX-based
output to \XLP{} because, while there was a free version of RenderX,
the output contained a watermark.  By implementing the ability to
export to \PDF{} via \XeLaTeX, watermarks could be avoided all
together. The \XeLaTeX{} method of \PDF{} production is now the
default method to produce \PDF{} documents, although the RenderX
method is still possible.

Maintaining a separation of content and style in the \XLP{}
envionrment was a key design requirement. When the \XeLaTeX{} method
of \PDF{} production was introduced, \XLP{} already had a way to
format output per a user-created publisher style sheet—allowing great
flexibility due to the separation of style and content. Using \TeX{}
technologies meant the developer (Andrew Black) needed to be able to
map from an \XLP{} publisher style sheet to \XeLaTeX. It was known
that \LaTeX\ was the ideal \TeX{} implementation to target. However,
pure \LaTeX\ came with predefined output formatting for front matter,
chapters, sections, back matter, etc.  Pure \LaTeX, then, would not
allow direct control of formatting of all of these per an \XLP{}
user-defined publisher style sheet.  This required overriding these
standard features of \LaTeX\ with a custom implementation of the
\TeX{} commands needed to control formatting. \XLP{} takes a custom
approach in implementing flexibility here.  The programmer of \XLP{}
recently discovered \texttt{memoir}\footnote{\tbsurl{ctan.org/pkg/memoir}}
\cite{wilson:2007} \cite{wilson:2021}. As a package, \texttt{memoir} accomplishes many
of the same tasks and could be considered to replace some of the
custom code if it were shown to be easy to implement and that the size
of the total \XLP{} code base would be reduced.

The distributability of the software was also seen as a design
requirement. Distributability is understood to have two components:
license and accessability, including size.

From the outset, \XLP{} was designed to be costless to the end
user. It is licensed under the MIT license, and its code is currently
available on Github.\footnote{\tbhurl{github.com/sillsdev/XLingPap}}
The \XXE{} had a costless Personal Use License that met this requirement for
the vast majority of the target audience of \XLP{}.  The few
\XLP{} users who did not meet the terms of that license most
likely would be able to afford to purchase (or have their organization
purchase) a professional license of the \XXE{}.  The actual \XLP{}
plug-in has always been free.

The software size of \XLP{} is a major design influencer.  Many of the
expected users of \XLP{} live and work in places around the world
where Internet connections are characterized by high costs, low
bandwidth capacity, and general unavailability.  Therefore, the
download required to install \XLP{} needed to be as small as
possible. On Windows the current full \XLP{} installer is 146MB, and
the \XXE{} installer is 116MB. Both are required. This stands in
contrast to the TeXLive 2010 installer which is about 1.2GB download
and 2.38GB uncompressed.  The size constraint impacts \XLP{} because
its distribution must be independent of larger mainstream \TeX{}
distribution solutions such as \TeX{}Live which have a large
footprint.  Therefore the developer identified which \LaTeX\ packages
and binaries were needed and created a custom installation package
which met the required specifications.

\XLP{} currently uses the following \LaTeX{} packages (in
alphabetical order):

\begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
\texttt{attachfile2} & \texttt{lineno}\\
\texttt{booktabs} & \texttt{longtable}\\
\texttt{calc} & \texttt{lscape}\\
\texttt{color} & \texttt{mdframed}\\
\texttt{colortbl} & \texttt{multirow}\\
\texttt{etoolbox} & \texttt{normalem}\\
\texttt{fancyhdr} & \texttt{polyglossia}\\
\texttt{fontspec} & \texttt{setspace}\\
\texttt{footmisc} & \texttt{tabularx}\\
\texttt{hyperref} & \texttt{xltxtra}\\
\end{tabular}

The twenty \LaTeX\ packages that are part of the custom \XLP{}
distribution are still rather large (29MB) for someone for whom
Internet bandwidth is an expensive and inconsistent commodity. To
reduce bandwidth requirements two assumptions were made which have
more or less proven to obtain. The first assumption that the developer
made was that the twenty packages and binaries would not need to
change over time; in contrast, the second assumption was that \XLP{}
would acquire new features and need bug fixes. These assumptions
resulted in an architecture where page layout information expressed in
\XML{} is translated via custom \TeX{} commands to either \TeX{}
directly or to commands understood by \LaTeX{} packages distributed
with \XLP{}. This abstraction layer was then executed when the
\XeLaTeX{} file was processed. This middle layer has granted \XLP{}
flexibility in adding new code and capabilities while keeping the
“heavy” \LaTeX\ packages stable. The net result is a “heavy” first
install package, but light-weight upgrade packages (6.21MB). In the
thirteen year history of development, there have been a few occasions
where upgrades have required the download of new “heavy” packages. One
such case was when the ability to use framed units was added. These
elements depend on the
\texttt{mdframed}\footnote{\tbsurl{ctan.org/pkg/mdframed}} package
\cite{DanielandSchubert:2013}. The architecture separating stable
packages from custom code, however, has generally worked out well and
kept update sizes low.

\subsection{\PDF{} production}

We know of two pathways for converting XML content into PDFs. The
first is via \XSLFO{}, and the second is via \TeXML{} which converts
\XML{} content to \TeX{} formatted documents. Given certain
limitations in both \XSLFO{} and \TeXML{}, \XLP{} uses a custom
(or third) method. When an author instructs \XLP{} to produce
\PDF{} output via \XeLaTeX, \XLP{} produces a \TeXML{}-like \XML{}
file. This is then converted into a \LaTeX\ formatted document via a set
of \XSLT{} transforms and processed via \XeLaTeX{} to produce the
\PDF{}.  Figure~3 contains a diagram of the data handling process.

\subsection{\TeXML{}}

\TeXML{} was discovered in the process of planning for the transition
of the default \PDF{} renderer from RenderX (an \XSLFO{} processor) to
\XeLaTeX{}. Initial analysis conducted in 2009 understood \TeXML{} to
have two infelicities for use-cases required in linguistic publishing
with \XLP{}:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \TeXML{} has Python as a dependency and the developer did not
  want to require \XLP{} users to install a version of Python
  specifically for \TeXML{}.  This is especially the case since that
  version of Python might conflict with other installed versions of
  Python on their operating systems.  Moreover, this approach would
  make the installation package for \XLP{} much larger due to the
  inclusion of Python.
\item \XLP{} users require a high degree of control for white
  space. The fine grain control of whitespace was not clearly possible
  via \TeXML{}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Control characters}

Even with the use of Unicode in the text of documents, there are some
features of typesetting with \TeX{}-based implementations which
require the use of control characters. Additionally, \XML{} also has
control characters. In \TeX{} these include \texttt{{[}},
  \texttt{{]}}, \texttt{\textless{}}, and
\texttt{\textgreater{}}. When transforming data between \XML{} and
\TeX{}, \TeX{} control characters and commands need to be escaped to
ensure proper data processing. This has been implemented via Java
since Java was already present in the dependency stack due to \XXE{}
requiring it. Additionally, some small methods have been written in
Java to provide additional access to features via the graphical user
interface.

\subsection{Ling-\TeX{}}

One might ask, “Why not add more linguistic related \TeX{} packages to
the available stack, or use those instead of creating custom code?”
The answer has two simple parts: First, in 2009 the linguistic
capabilities of \TeX{} packages were different than they are today.
Second, \XLP{} is more than a \TeX{} document producer.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[scale=.525]{Outputs.png}
\caption{\XLP{} combines style and content information contained
  in its custom \XML{} and then exports it into three different formats
  for further processing.}
\end{figure}

Besides \TeX{}, \XLP{} also produces \XSLFO{} and
\XHTML{}/\CSS{} outputs. When new features are considered for typesetting design, all output formats need to be considered.


When the developer began to implement the
\XeLaTeX{}-based output, he discovered the Ling-\TeX{}
group\footnote{\tbhurl{web.archive.org/web/20150702123633/http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~dag/ling-tex/}}
which also ran the Ling-TeX mailing list from
1995–2018.\footnote{\tbsurl{ling-tex.ifi.uio.narkive.com}} Ling-TeX
seemed to be the locus of activity in linguistic typesetting even
though other web pages discussing linguistics and \TeX{} also existed,
e.g.,
Essex,\footnote{\tbsurl{www.essex.ac.uk/linguistics/external/clmt/latex4ling}}
UPenn.\footnote{\tbsurl{www.ling.upenn.edu/advice/latex.html}} Today,
now that the mailing list is no-longer in operation, many of the
mailing list participants can be found interacting on the \TeX{}
stackexchange.\footnote{\tbsurl{tex.stackexchange.com}}

State-of-the-Art for \TeX{}-based linguistic publishing in 2009, as
recommended by the Ling-\TeX{} website, suggested using
\texttt{covington} and {\em ling-mac}—the list of macros discussed in
\cite{thiele:1995}. These macros were used to solve similar use cases,
among others, to those already implemented by \XLP{}. The more
commonly implemented typesetting tasks are outlined in Section~4.
%These figure refs need to be re-evaluated for accuracy since I added another figure.
Initial analysis of \texttt{covington} and other packages revealed
limitations in the number of rows an interlinear text example could
display, a typesetting capability \XLP{} had already overcome via
\XSLFO{} processing using RenderX. \XLP{} had the following
capabilities for typesetting interlinears:

\begin{itemize}
\item no limits on the number of lines within an interlinear grouping;
\item no limits on the number of free and/or literal lines;
\item the ability to include a source reference within the
  interlinear; and especially
\item the ability to tag interlinear items with an \acro{ISO} 639-3
  code for the language used in the interlinear.
\end{itemize}

At the time the best solution given the state of the \TeX{} packages
available was custom \TeX{} scripts, although now similar features may
be possible via other packages. See Pellard \cite{pellard:2019} for
discussion of approaches in \TeX{} and his solution
\texttt{typgloss}.\footnote{\tbsurl{github.com/tpellard/typgloss}}
Figures~5–7 contain example output illustrating some of the special
capabilities \XLP{} offers.

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[scale=.97]{ExamplePDFInterlinear.png}
\caption{Interlinear example from \cite{marlett:2012}. Note the
  example numbers on the left followed by example groups (a) and
  (b). Each interlinear then also has a language indicator in square
  brackets. Customization allows for as many rows per group as is
  required. Finally, on the right the hyperlinked citation to the reference for the 
  source text is indicated.}
\end{figure*}

\section{Typesetting tasks \XLP{} users often encounter}

Linguistic documents have several formatting needs that other kinds of
documents do not. This section discusses some of them.

\subsection{Numbered example layouts}

Linguistic documents usually have many numbered examples.  The prose
often refers to examples near the exemplar material (Figures, Tables, Examples, etc.) or to previous examples.
\XLP{} automatically keeps track of the ordinal indicators while allowing for different systems of numeration (1,2, 3; a,b,c; i, ii, iii, etc.).  Authors, and
publishing style sheets often make use of table-like design layouts
including: lists of words along with their glosses (as shown in
Figure~6) and interlinear clauses (as shown in Figure~5), with some
cases even having headings in portions of the example.

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{GraphitePDF-Slide24.png}
\caption{List of words as seen in \cite{rasmussen:2018}}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Interlinear glossed texts}

There is a long tradition within linguistics and language study of presenting phrases containing different languages but the same content as interlinear texts. Di-Biase-Dyson et al. \cite{DiBiaseDysonEtAl:2009} trace the practice back as far as the 1652 publication of Kircher \cite{Kircher:1652}. More recent publications display significant variation in page layout related to interlinear glossed texts and interlinear examples. Variation exists in three dimentions:

\begin{itemize}
\item content,% (headings, line limits for gloss tier, original tier, translation tier, free translation tier),
\item data-structure of the encoding,
\item page layout.% (wrapping, word alignement/morpheme alignement, grouping of lines, sub-examples)
\end{itemize}

A full deomonstration of the variation in content and its positioning across common style sheets in linguistics is beyond the scope of this paper. Significant variations include presences or absence of the following elements: index elements such as example numbers or sub-numbers (as shown in Figure~5), headings to the interlinear, speaker indicator, language indicator, citation indicator pointing to the lager text from which the exemplar element is taken (see Figure~5 for example), and limits on the number of rows in the original, gloss, translation, and free translation tiers.

Existing \TeX{} packages approach these content requirements in different ways. As far as we can tell the following commonly used packages for interlinear glossing all have limitations to some degree. For example, \texttt{expex} does not offer a content solution for the language code or the citation. The package \texttt{langsci-gb4e},\footnote{\tbsurl{ctan.org/pkg/langsci-gb4e}} a fork of \texttt{gb4e},\footnote{\tbsurl{ctan.org/pkg/gb4e}} supports the {\em Leipzig Glossing Rules},\footnote{\tbsurl{eva.mpg.de/lingua/pdf/Glossing-Rules.pdf}} a commonly adapted set of linguistic typesetting conventions. However, while the {\em Leipzig Glossing Rules} do call for the language name or identifier to appear on the right hand side of the interlinear glossed text, it does not have a place for the citation. The package \texttt{linguex} does not have either language or citation built in content places built in. With these considerations \XLP{} offeres more to authors than other pacakges in the \TeX{} ecosystem, even though this meant creating custom \TeX{} scripts to implement interlinear texts.

There are still some reasons related to data-structure for considering \XLP{}. Interlinear glossed texts are often stored in one of a few formats: ELAN files,\footnote{\tbsurl{archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan}} FLEx Text files,\footnote{\tbsurl{software.sil.org/fieldworks}} Toolbox Text files,\footnote{\tbsurl{software.sil.org/toolbox}} \LaTeX{} files, or custom project-specific \XML{} files. Moving content from analysis and markup tools to typeseting tools is an everpresent need for linguists. Several tools such as ELAN and FLEx have well established workflows for data transfer \cite{SalffnerGavid:2014}. FLEx is often considered the tool of choice for many fieldlinguists, language documentors, and lexicographers. For many linguists entering the field it is the tool of choice over older tools like toolbox due to built in collaborative features and grammar parsers \cite{BeierandMichael:2022}. \XLP{} has the capability to reference (for inclusion in a typeset document) a FLEx text's XML ouput. This presents FLEx users the opertunity to typeset their texts rather easily. Using the \XML{} document referencing strategy allows for authors to reflow typesetting outputs ieasily if they make changes in their FLEx enviroment.  We have also had reports of linguists using the FLEx-\XLP{} bridge to typeset ELAN texts in \LaTeX{} documents. They capture the \XeLaTeX{} document prior to render and then copy the relevant \TeX{} sections to their primary document.

Still finally, there is the matter of page layout. The main types of vairation in page layout we have seen include the grouping of lines into sets or subsets (see Figure~5 for example), the labling of sets and subsets, wrapping of interlinear glosses across lines (recall that these may themselves include three or more lines), and the alignment of the various elements of content within the interlinear glosses. We have seen word and morpheme aligned interlinears.  \XLP{} automatically wraps interlinears which makes the author's job much easier.  Figure~7 in FC:1 and FC:2 demonstrate the wrapping of interlinear glossed texts. It does so by formatting each aligned word in an hbox and then having \XeLaTeX{} put them together in a hanging indent paragraph. This is based on the work of Kew \& McConnel 1990 \cite{kew:mcconnel}.

\begin{figure*}

\end{figure*}

\subsection{Gloss abbreviations}

Linguists standardly use glosses for indicating the meaning of pieces
of words (morphemes). One common set of glosses is the Leipzig Glosses. However, Leipzig Glosses are not universially used for several reasons including: 

\begin{itemize}
\item some authors have established their own tradition within their works which they started prior to the release of the Leipzig Glosses,
\item they are not comprehensive, and
\item they are not throetically sufficent for some linguists.
\end{itemize}

 \XLP{} approaches this by providing built in access to Leipzig Glosses, but also allowing the author to define a set of
abbreviations and their definitions.  When producing the output,
\XLP{} creates hyperlinks between the abbreviation and its
definition. This allows for the automatic generation of a table of abbreviations used.

%1. LaTeX and text mining.
%2. Language code in the XML
%3. IGTs are old.
%4. Leipzig is a publishing standard which is making its way into corpora.
%5. There are non-leipzig abbrs, and extensions to leipzig.
%6. XLingPaper has been used as a transfer from flex to LaTeX.

\section{Outputs \LaTeX{} allow that others do not}

While \XLP{} has a large array of linguistically-oriented
formatting capabilities, there are some that only the \XeLaTeX{}
output can produce.  This is, of course, due to the formatting power
of \TeX{} and \XeLaTeX{}.

\subsection{Automatically wrapping interlinears}

One of the most popular features of \XLP{} is its ability to
automatically wrap long interlinear examples and lines in interlinear
texts.  

\subsection{Font rendering}
%for discussing fonts several works need to be added to the bibliography: 
% Correll, Sharon. 2000. “Graphite: An Extensible Rendering Engine for Complex Writing Systems.” Presentation Paper presented at the 17th International Unicode Conference, San Jose, California. http://rabbits.continuation.org/w/images/7/73/Graphite_paper.pdf.
%Kew, Jonathan. 2007. “XeTeX Live.” TUGboat 29 (1): 146–50. http://root.tug.org/tugboat/tb29-1/tb91kew.pdf.

\XeLaTeX{} renders fonts extremely well.  It can even handle special
features requiring Graphite\footnote{\tbsurl{graphite.sil.org}}
processing.  For other outputs, some fonts (such as Charis \SIL{}) may
not line up vertically as expected due to them having different
ascender and descender values. One has to add custom commands to deal
with these.  In the case of Graphite, they may not be able to be done
at all.  The RenderX way of producing \PDF{} cannot handle stacked
diacritics, but the \XeLaTeX{} way does it very well.

\subsection{Hyphenation for non-English languages}

Since we use the \texttt{polyglossia} package, one can write an
\XLP{} document in a non-English language and \XeLaTeX{} will
hyphenate according to that language’s hyphenation rules.

\subsection{Author contact information}

\XLP{} allows one to define a set of contact information for
authors.  Only the \XeLaTeX{} output is able to format them correctly.

\subsection{Vertical fill}

For title page material, only the \XeLaTeX{} output allows using
vertical fill between items.  The other outputs require using overt,
fixed spacing values.

\subsection{Blank page}

When one wants a totally blank even-numbered page between a final
odd-numbered page and the next odd-numbered page which begins, say, a
chapter or appendix, only the \XeLaTeX{} approach is able to do this.

\section{Features other outputs have that the \LaTeX{} output does not}

\XeLaTeX{} does not allow for custom table cell padding and spacing.
Having said that, Andy cannot remember any \XLP{} user ever asking
for a way to do this for the \XeLaTeX{} output.  It just looks great.

Background color is not available for section titles.

Section 11.17.1.1 “Known limitations of using
\XeLaTeX{}” in the \XLP{} user documentation lists known
problems.
%  See \tbsurl{software.sil.org/downloads/r/xlingpaper/resources/documentation/xxe7/UserDocXMLmind.htm#sXeTeXLimitations}.

\subsection{Custom \TeX{} commands}
% Should the content of this subsection be discussed in another place within the paper?
\XLP{} has a number of custom commands that enable it to handle
various tasks in a way that is consistent with our desired outcomes.
The following lists some of them in a schematic way:

\begin{tabular}{@{}lp{1.5in}@{}}
{\bf Command for} & {\bf Purpose}\\
Table of contents & Store and retrieve page numbers; format the
contents.\\ Lists & Numbered and bulleted lists with control over
indents, etc.\\ Examples & Example number and example content, where
the content can be a line, a list of lines, a set of words, a list of
a set of words, interlinear, a list of interlinears, etc.\\
Indexes & Handle keeping track of \XLP{}’s indexing
capability, including page numbers.\\
Interlinears & Handle lines in an interlinear text or example,
including dealing with an \acro{ISO} 639-3 code in an interlinear
example.\\
Block quotes & Handle special cases needed for block quotes.\\
Table headers & Attempt to calculate a column’s width via its
contents.\\
\end{tabular}

\section{Conclusion}

While the \XLP{} approach to composing documents via DTD controlled
user interface limitations has great value in and of itself, the fact
that it can produce great looking output via \XeLaTeX{} makes the
learning curve rewarding.  We feel that being able to produce \PDF{}
via \XeLaTeX{} has made \XLP{} a fantastic tool for linguists.
