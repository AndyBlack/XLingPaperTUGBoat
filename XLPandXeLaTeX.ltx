\begin{abstract}
We discuss the use of \TeX\ technologies by XLingPaper, an authoring
tool for producing academically oriented publications with features
required for linguistic publishing. We present the \TeX\ modules used,
and the rationale for the history of its development.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

Within the publishing industry there are several notable products for
producing complex documents in beautiful formats. \TeX
\cite{knuth:1984},\cite{knuth:1986} is one of the well known
publishing technologies used to meet these needs. Since 2000, \XML
based technologies such as
XSL‑FO\footnote{\url{https://www.w3.org/TR/xsl11}} or the
\TeX{}ML
project\cite{lovell:1999}\footnote{\url{http://getfo.org/texml}} have
also seen use to integrate content and compose complex documents such
as textbooks and maintenance manuals. Requirements for composing these
large, inter-linked documents birthed the development of tools like
XMLmind\footnote{\url{https://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor}} and
Xpublisher.\footnote{\url{https://www.xpublisher.com/products}} These
can be used to compose the content within predefined \XML\ structures.
XLingPaper\cite{blackandblack:2012},\cite{black:2009},\cite{black:2017}
seeks to provide a constrained enviroment in which authors of complex
works dealing with language descriptions and linguistic analysese can
focus on content structure independently from the styling requirments
of publishers. The software has a growing number of users who have
succesfully typeset complex documents including:

\begin{itemize}
\item master theses\cite{Wood:2012},\cite{lamicela:2020},\cite{paterson:2021},
\item doctorial dissertations\cite{ebarb:2014},\cite{rasmussen:2018},
\item textbooks\cite{marlett:2019},
\item linguistic grammars\cite{buck:2018},
\item journal articles\cite{brownie:2013}, and
\item bilingual software documentation\cite{BeadleandLee:2020a},\cite{BeadleandLee:2020b}.
\end{itemize}

XLingpaper\footnote{\url{https://software.sil.org/xlingpaper}} is a plug-in to the XMLmind XML Editor. XLingPaper benefits from XMLmind's Java-based implementation, which allows it to be used on MacOS, Windows, and Linux. XLingPaper, via a DTD, defines several
document classes (articles, books, chapters, etc., as illustrated in Figure~1),
in each case providing document layout sections (paragraphs, examples, endnotes,
etc.). By working within the user-interface of XMLmind, formatting
errors are reduced because users are constrained on where in the
document flow they can introduce block and line level document elements.
That is, first, authors cannot input \XeLaTeX\ code directly into the document and second, the introduction of layout sections within the document flow is constrained via the DTD.

\section{What is XLingPaper?}

As mentioned above, XLingPaper is an \XML- and Java-based computer
plug-in for the XMLmind XML Editor.  It is designed to make writing,
reading, and publishing linguistic papers, grammars, and books better
and more consistent. A full list of benefits to all parties in the publishing workflow is available.\cite{black:2017} XLingPaper can produce linguistic documents with
at least five outputs, all from the same source document: \PDF{} (version 1.5), Web
pages (HTML 4), Microsoft Word (.doc), Open Office Writer (.odt), and ePUB. It automatically
numbers sections, figures, tables, and examples. It keeps track of internal references to these entites along with citation references, and gloss abbreviations.  This keeps numbering and reference links dependable and automated. It also
automatically generates abbreviations used and references cited (using a custom references implimentation).

Unlike most editing programs which are based on either the \WYSIWYG{}
paradigm or as text editors used to code or produce Markdown,
XLingPaper (via the XMLmind XML Editor) is a structured editor. Rather
than visually structuring the document to look the way it is to be
formatted, the author “marks up” the items in the
document according to their kind.  One of the many values this gives
is that there is a “grammar” of what a well-formed
linguistic document looks like.  This makes moving, replacing,
switching, or reordering sections, chapters, and examples less error
prone becasue it prevents users from inadvertently creating ill-formed
documents.

The following sections of this paper discuss the \TeX{} technologies used. 

\section{XLingPaper and \TeX{}}

Due to the heavy reliance on Unicode in modern language documentation
and linguistic work, XLingPaper specifically uses \XeLaTeX{} and
compatible packages to produce \PDF{} outputs.  The following sections
provide more detail on the design requirements and packages used.

\subsection{Design desiderata for \TeX{} with XLingPaper}

From the outset, XLingPaper was designed to be free.  The XMLmind XML Editor had a Personal Use License that fit the bill for the vast majority of the target
audience of XLingPaper.  The few that did not meet the terms of that
license most likely would be able to afford to purchase (or have their
organization purchase) a professional version of the XMLmind XML
Editor.  The actual XLingPaper plugin has always been free.

Prior to 2009 XLingPaper used
RenderX\footnote{\url{http://www.renderx.com}} to produce \PDF{}
documents. However, in 2009 plans were made to add \XeLaTeX-based
output to XLingPaper because, while there was a free version of
RenderX, the output contained a watermark.  By implementing the
ability to export to \PDF{} via \XeLaTeX, there would be no water
 marks in PDF documents.

At the time, XLingPaper had a way to format output per a user-created
publisher style sheet.  This meant the developer (Andrew Black) needed to be able to map from an XLingPaper publisher style sheet to \XeLaTeX.  This was the second
criterion.  He knew that he wanted to use \LaTeX\ but that pure
\LaTeX\ came with predefined output formatting for front matter,
chapters, sections, back matter, etc.  Pure \LaTeX, then, would not
allow direct control of formatting of all of these per an XLingPaper
user-defined publisher style sheet.  He would need to “roll his own”
way of handling these.  (Unfortunately, he did not learn about the
\texttt{memoir} package until several years later; otherwise he might
have used it.)

The third criterion concerned some of the target audience for
XLingPaper.  Many of the expected users of XLingPaper live in places
around the world where Internet connections are poor.  Therefore, the
download required to install XLingPaper needed to be as small as
possible.  This meant requiring users to use something like \TeX{}Live
was out of the question.  Andy determined which \LaTeX\ packages and
binaries were needed and created a custom installation package for
just those items.

This was still rather large for someone with poor Internet.  The hope
was that this set of packages and binaries would not need to change
over time, given that XLingPaper was expected to include new features
and need bug fixes.  In fact, for any custom commands, he did not
create a separate XLingPaper package containing them and include them
in this custom set of packages.  Rather he generated them as commands
in the file processed by XeLaTeX.  The thinking was that it was more
likely new XLingPaper-specific commands would be needed than new
\LaTeX\ packages.  This has proven true over time.  While it was
necessary to create new versions of the packaging, such as when he
added framed units via the \texttt{mdframed} package, generally it has
been the case that adding items to the package has not been needed
very much.

\subsection{PDF production}

When an author has XLingPaper produce \PDF\ output via \XeLaTeX,
XLingPaper produces a TeXML-like \XML\ file.  This is then
converted into \LaTeX\ format via a set of XSLT transforms and given
to \XeLaTeX\ which produces the \PDF.  Figure~2 contains a diagram of
this process.

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[scale=1.4]{PDFCreation.png}
\caption{XLingPaper output process}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{TeXML}

When Andy began implementing the \XeLaTeX{}-based output, he found TeXML, but understood it to have two infelicities:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \TeX{}ML required Python and he did not want to force XLingPaper users to have to install a version of Python for \TeX{}ML when that version may conflict with other versions of Python they might already have installed.  Furthermore, this approach would make the installation package much larger because of needing to include Python.
\item He also needed some extensions for formatting white space (more finely as far as he could tell).
\end{enumerate}

He did implement some Java code to deal with mapping certain characters used in \TeX{} commands to their \TeX{} equivalents.  He used Java because the XMLmind XML Editor is written in Java and XLingPaper already used Java code to improve the user experience in the XMLmind XML Editor.

\subsection{Ling-TeX}

At the time Andy began implementing the \XeLaTeX{}-based output, he discovered the Ling-TeX group.  From what he could tell, the packages that help with interlinear texts did not allow for the larger number of capabilities XLingPaper already dealt with.  So he rolled his own.  Figure~3 contains an example output with some of the special capabilities XLingPaper offers.

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[scale=.97]{ExamplePDFInterlinear.png}
\caption{Interlinear example}
\end{figure*}

\section{Typesetting tasks XLingPaper users often encounter}

Linguistic documents have several formatting needs that other kinds of documents do not. This section discusses some of them.

\subsection{Numbered example layouts}

Linguistic documents usually have many numbered examples.  The prose often refers to examples near the material or to previous examples.  XLingPaper automatically keeps track of the numbers.  Besides table-like layouts, linguists also need lists of words along with their glosses (as shown in Figure~4), interlinear clauses (as shown in Figure~3), and even having headings in portions of the example.

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{GraphitePDF-Slide24.png}
\caption{List of words}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Automatically wrapping interlinear texts}

Many linguists want to include interlinear glossed text in their document.  XLingPaper allows these to be wrapped automatically which makes the author's job much easier.  Figure~5 shows one such text portion.

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[scale=0.97]{TextPDF-Slide21.png}
\caption{Wrapped interlinear text}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Gloss abbreviations}

Linguists standardly use glosses for indicating the meaning of pieces of words (morphemes).  XLingPaper allows the author to define a set of abbreviations and their definitions.  When producing the output, XLingPaper creates hyperlinks between the abbreviation and its definition.

\section{Outputs \LaTeX{} allow that others do not}

While XLingPaper has a large array of linguistically-oriented formatting capabilities, there are some that only the \XeLaTeX{} output can produce.  This is, of course, due to the formatting power of \TeX{} and \XeLaTeX{}.

\subsection{Automatically wrapping interlinears}

One of the most popular features of XLingPaper is its ability to automatically wrap long interlinear examples and lines in interlinear texts.  It does so by formatting each aligned word in an hbox and then having \XeLaTeX{} put them together in a hanging indent paragraph.  This is based on the work of Kew \& McConnel 1990 \cite{kew:mcconnel}.

\subsection{Font rendering}

\XeLaTeX{} renders fonts extremely well.  It can even handle special features requiring Graphite\footnote{\url{graphite.sil.org}} processing.  For other outputs, some fonts (such as Charis SIL) may not line up vertically as expected due to them having different ascender and descender values. One has to add custom commands to deal with these.  In the case of Graphite, they may not be able to be done at all.  The RenderX way of producing \PDF{} cannot handle stacked diacritics, but the \XeLaTeX{} way does it very well.

\subsection{Hyphenation for non-English languages}

Since we use the \texttt{polyglossia} package, one can write an XLingPaper document in a non-English language and \XeLaTeX{} will hyphenate according to that language’s hyphenation rules.

\subsection{Author contact information}

XLingPaper allows one to define a set of contact information for authors.  Only the \XeLaTeX{} output is able to format them correctly.

\subsection{Vertical fill}

For title page material, only the \XeLaTeX{} output allows using vertical fill between items.  The other outputs require using overt, fixed spacing values.

\subsection{Blank page}

When one wants a totally blank even-numbered page between a final odd-numbered page and the next odd-numbered page which begins, say, a chapter or appendix, only the \XeLaTeX{} approach is able to do this.

\section{Features other outputs have that the \LaTeX{} output does not}

\XeLaTeX{} does not allow for custom table cell padding and spacing.  Having said that, Andy cannot remember any XLingPaper user ever asking for a way to do this for the \XeLaTeX{} output.  It just looks great.

Background color is not available for section titles.

Section 11.17.1.1 “Known limitations of using \XeLaTeX{}” in the XLingPaper user documentation lists known problems.%  See \tbsurl{software.sil.org/downloads/r/xlingpaper/resources/documentation/xxe7/UserDocXMLmind.htm#sXeTeXLimitations}.

\subsection{List of \LaTeX{} packages used}

XLingPaper currently uses the following \XeLaTeX{} packages (in alphabetical order):

\begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
\texttt{attachfile2} & \texttt{lineno}\\
\texttt{booktabs} & \texttt{longtable}\\
\texttt{calc} & \texttt{lscape}\\
\texttt{color} & \texttt{mdframed}\\
\texttt{colortbl} & \texttt{multirow}\\
\texttt{etoolbox} & \texttt{normalem}\\
\texttt{fancyhdr} & \texttt{polyglossia}\\
\texttt{fontspec} & \texttt{setspace}\\
\texttt{footmisc} & \texttt{tabularx}\\
\texttt{hyperref} & \texttt{xltxtra}\\
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Custom \TeX{} commands}

XLingPaper has a number of custom commands that enable it to handle various tasks in a way that is consistent with our desired outcomes.  The following lists some of them in a schematic way:

\begin{tabular}{@{}lp{1.5in}@{}}
{\bf Command for} & {\bf Purpose}\\
Table of contents & Store and retrieve page numbers; format the contents.\\
Lists & Numbered and bulleted lists with control over indents, etc.\\
Examples & Example number and example content, where the content can be a line, a list of lines, a set of words, a list of a set of words, interlinear, a list of interlinears, etc.\\
Indexes & Handle keeping track of XLingPaper’s indexing capability, including page numbers.\\
Interlinears & Handle lines in an interlinear text or example, including dealing with an ISO 639-3 code in an interlinear example.\\
Block quotes & Handle special cases needed for block quotes.\\
Table headers & Attempt to calculate a column’s width via its contents.\\
\end{tabular}

\section{Conclusion}

While the XLingPaper approach to writing linguistic documents has great value in and of itself, the fact that it can produce great looking output via \XeLaTeX{} makes it very worthwhile learning to use.  We feel that being able to produce \PDF{} via \XeLaTeX{} has made XLingPaper a fantastic tool for linguists.
